# JARVIS
[J]*ust* [A]*nother* [R]*ather* [V]*ery* [I]*gnorant* [S]*ystem*

JARVIS is a bot developed for use by my friends and I on XMPP. It started as just a weather alert bot, and progressed from there.
Internally he uses a MongoDB server for dealing with data persistence. One day I'll detail its 'schema' here in the unlikely event someone wants to run their own JARVIS.

### Features
   * Alert of active weather alerts directly from NWS (filtered by severity).
   * Poll the GitHub API for monitoring for new commits.
   * Manage user accounts on the XMPP server we own.

### Use XMPP and like JARVIS?
JARVIS is technically capable of handling all the features listed above for anyone who uses XMPP as we do. If you're interested in having
him do what he does for you just send me a message here on GitHub and we'll get you set up. He only listens to subscribers/admin for most things.
