# JARVIS
[J]ust [A]nother [R]ather [V]ery [I]gnorant [S]ystem

It's a simple bot I've been tinkering with.

It's basically a crummy async tcp server thrown together with an xmpp bot.

Currently just retrieves active weather alerts for the users in its MongoDB and sends them an XMPP message about it.

I will update this readme with more information should it be required. It's basically just a pet project to keep my hands busy.
