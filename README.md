# JARVIS
[J]ust [A]nother [R]ather [V]ery [I]gnorant [S]ystem

It's a simple bot I've been tinkering with.

It's basically a crummy async tcp server thrown together with an xmpp bot.

Currently retrieves active weather alerts and free games from humblebundle store for the users in its MongoDB and sends them an XMPP message about it.

I will update this readme with more information should it be required. It's basically just a pet project to keep my hands busy.
